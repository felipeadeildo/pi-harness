  <strong>Pi runs every command without asking. This makes it ask.</strong><br>
  A set of extensions on top of <a href="https://pi.dev">Pi</a>, in one install: they ask before running something, they ask you before guessing, and the screen tells you what is happening.

## What changes

**Every command says who let it run.** A small model reads it first. When it is sure the command is fine it runs and says how sure it was; when it is not, the command comes to you with the reason it is asking.

**One dialog answers both.** A permission ask and a question from the model look the same and take the same keys: yes, always yes or no, with a note you can leave on any answer. Saying no to `npm install` with "use pnpm instead" reaches the model, so it stops guessing what you meant.

**Nothing is hidden, and nothing is final.** The time, the cost and how fast the model writes change without moving the line you type on. Every answer can be undone, and `Alt+S` shows what each piece is set to.

## What you get

| Piece                                 | What it does                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Permission](packages/ask-permission) | Asks before a command runs. A model answers the easy ones for you, with the reason on the command, and the ones it is not sure about come to you |
| [Questions](packages/ask-questions)   | The model asks instead of guessing, with options, a preview of what each one leads to, and a note on any of them                                 |
| [Look](packages/look)                 | The start screen, the editor with the branch and the model on its borders, and a box around each command with its output and how long it took    |
| [Providers](packages/providers)       | Bills Anthropic requests to the Claude plan you already pay for, and keeps several accounts with a switch to the next one when a limit hits      |

## One piece, or all of them

`@adeildo/pi-harness` brings every piece, and `pi config` turns any of them off. Each piece is also its own package: `pi install npm:@adeildo/pi-look` brings the screen and nothing else.

There is no fork. Everything installs on top of Pi, and `pi remove` puts Pi back the way it was.
