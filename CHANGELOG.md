# Changelog

Every `@adeildo/` package in this repository shares one version, one tag and this changelog. The entries below 4.0.0 are from before, when `pi-ask-permission` was the only package.

## [5.6.0](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/compare/v5.5.0...v5.6.0) (2026-10-07)


### Features

## [5.1.0](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/compare/v5.0.0...v5.1.0) (2026-10-02)


### Features

* **ask-permission:** bring the questions dialog with the package and drop the classic one ([8546f71](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/8546f71dc06fdc32e4ddc052ee012c27db727bdb))
* **ask-questions:** redesign the dialog with a fixed-size detail panel, inline notes and tabs that show what is answered ([8e83b4b](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/8e83b4b0ffb1870cb46739e8ec3eba442c067b38))

## [5.0.0](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/compare/v4.1.0...v5.0.0) (2026-10-01)

Every piece lives on one settings screen now, and a new package joins the set: the model asks with options instead of guessing.

This release needs **pi 0.99.2**, which is what MCP and the tool annotations come from.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **ask-permission:** the judge is set with a model, a policy and a rigor, and it reads your last message as the intent behind the call. `judge.provider`, `judge.enabled` and `judge.tools` are gone, and the retired keys are removed from the settings file on the next session, with a notice ([87014f3](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/87014f3623604d8ed496b8e0a0645b05a1ed188f))
* **every piece:** one settings screen on `Alt+S`, a tab per piece, in place of `/perm` and `/look` ([9cc50c0](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/9cc50c05650c900265d08d00e151f9053c21b34a))
* **ask-permission:** four modes, manual, edits, judge and full, with `Alt+W` for calls outside the workspace ([3f0348a](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/3f0348ab164f758ff470758dfc69b30daf0dc753))

### Features

* **ask-questions:** a new package, `@adeildo/pi-ask-questions`, with the `ask_questions` tool. Every question comes with options, a preview of the option under the cursor, a note on any option whether it was picked or not, and a row for your own answer. The dialog is drawn in the flow of the screen instead of over the chat, so a tall one scrolls with the terminal ([95fc137](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/95fc137404b348bb8f1c1774a4e7dda75f70c980))
* **ask-permission, ask-questions:** one dialog for both. The permission ask goes through the questions package, with the call, the reason and the diff riding in the question. `always yes` then asks which calls to remember and for how long, and an answer typed in your own words blocks the call, with the text as the reason the model reads ([0ebcec2](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/0ebcec283b409f7771505098803003d6353150c2))
* **ask-permission:** a call to an MCP server follows the policy of its server, set on the Permission tab, and a call a codemode script made is decided on its own, instead of asking twice for one thing ([08e3810](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/08e38104297e274e05fa355155c532904d07af4b))
* **ask-permission:** a call that leaves the workspace offers to open that folder, for reads or as part of the workspace ([09cc796](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/09cc79648768d888e1230d35f0fd5cca9e05dcd0))
* **providers:** several accounts per provider. The pi login becomes the first account, another comes from the provider's own login, the active one is a session entry so a resume restores who paid, and `Alt+A` cycles them ([09049cf](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/09049cfbe32c656c468c926ffc770360b684308d), [2e8ef4b](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/2e8ef4b0497896ed6228cd48515f5523bad4f29e))
* **providers:** an account that hits its limit hands over to the next one, asking first by default ([5adbfb0](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/5adbfb0a020d37d5a8a2b4c33509fb2f50a6f897))
* **look:** the account sits next to the model, and the working line names the state in lower case instead of repeating the call being drafted ([4ef6328](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/4ef632884a9c47681dfb30d4af9813909d5dc138), [f689c2d](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/f689c2d87be7701dd92aa8b379c6b98b8d23f6f8))
* **look:** the wait is timed from the moment the request leaves the machine, and the token speed uses the ratio the session measured, in place of a flat four characters per token ([29e74b4](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/29e74b471cd9ee6dd72a62ac99ec163f7ba96957))
* **every piece:** the middle dots are gone from the dialogs, the hints and the status lines, and the footer separator defaults to a space ([a3814b4](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/a3814b4cbd177579a46fbb548c8274ff59ce3096))

### Dependencies

* the pi SDK is bumped to 0.99.2, which this release needs ([b600128](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/b600128))

### Bug Fixes

* **ask-permission:** read a bash command that sets a shell variable before it reads it, and then trust that variable only where bash surely set it and nothing else can change it afterwards ([cd7da40](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/cd7da405f5da4dfcbbc053013148b5a3c262a09a), [0387aa9](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/0387aa9eab80cefc9dc5ceadd290aebbb7fbfe7c))
* **ask-permission:** show what an MCP server declares in the dialog, and keep the registered tool name in `alwaysAsk` ([b4cec5f](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/b4cec5f53a65f11095293c9f6349400d15d9d5fb))
* **providers:** keep a refreshed token on the account it came from, lift a provider when its first account arrives rather than only at session start, and stop caching the native methods ([1e04718](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/1e0471869ae515222fbc27ec557d998a8d43e5ca), [1068ef4](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/1068ef48378a21fd2693afd2a1345e42a9dac17c), [4254a3d](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/4254a3d6d677c541c5351b2600ceafeab9925a54))
* **kit:** a feature that reads or writes a setting it never declared now throws, instead of reading a default forever ([e8a9bc8](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/e8a9bc81ccabd26c97ab0c00199926259668f766))

## [4.1.0](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.0) (2026-09-30)

### Features

* **harness:** `@adeildo/pi-harness` brings every piece: the permission dialog, the look and providers, one extension each, so `pi config` turns any of them off ([693b946](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/693b9464149de87e375054f505891ee82ec8a8a1))
* **look, providers:** each piece is also a package of its own, `@adeildo/pi-look` and `@adeildo/pi-providers`, for whoever wants only that one. With a piece installed both ways, the first copy runs and the other stays off ([693b946](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/693b9464149de87e375054f505891ee82ec8a8a1))

### Bug Fixes

* **release:** hand the terminal to npm so publish and trust can ask for 2FA ([45f0d3e](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness/commit/45f0d3ef7881e1d3444dc57c0a70ea2c844dc98d))
