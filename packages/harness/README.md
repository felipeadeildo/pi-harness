## What comes in it

| Piece                           | What it does                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Permission](../ask-permission) | Asks before a command runs, with a note the model reads. A model answers the easy ones for you           |
| [Questions](../ask-questions)   | The model asks instead of guessing, with options, a preview of each, a note on any and your own answer   |
| [Skill calls](../skills)        | Call the skills you already have from anywhere in a message, several at once, shown as chips             |
| [Look](../look)                 | The start screen, the editor with the branch and the model on its borders, and a box around each command |
| [Providers](../providers)       | Bills Anthropic OAuth requests to your Claude plan, and keeps several accounts per provider              |

All of them are on once the package is installed.

> [!WARNING]
> Providers makes Pi introduce itself to Anthropic as Claude Code whenever a request uses an Anthropic OAuth token. Using a subscription from anything other than Claude Code may break Anthropic's terms. Turn it off, as below, if you do not want that. A request with an API key goes out untouched.

## Turning a piece off

Each piece is its own extension in this package, so `pi config` switches off the one you do not want, globally or for one project. The settings file has a switch per feature too, read on the next `/reload`, and the feature ids are `permission`, `look`, `subscription`, `accounts`, `questions` and `skills`.

```json
{ "features": { "subscription": { "enabled": false } } }
```

To have only one piece, install its own package instead. With both installed, the first copy that loads runs the feature and the other stays off.

## Settings

`Alt+S` opens the settings of every piece. They live in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-harness/settings.json`, and each piece's page lists its own. A setting marked _project_ is also read from `.pi/extensions/pi-harness/settings.json` in a project Pi trusts, where the project value wins.

The whole set, with the pictures and the settings of each piece, is in the [root README](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness).

Part of [pi-harness](https://github.com/felipeadeildo/pi-harness), which is this package. Every piece also ships on its own, for whoever wants only that one.
