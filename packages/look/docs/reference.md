# Look reference

Everything the [README](../README.md) leaves out: the colours, every setting and segment, and how a line fits.

## Colours

The look never names a colour. Every piece names a **theme token**, so it follows whatever theme pi runs: `system`, `dark`, `light`, or a JSON of yours. Change the theme and every piece moves with it.

| What                                          | Token                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Folder                                        | `accent`                                                    |
| Branch                                        | `syntaxFunction`                                            |
| Ahead, staged / behind, modified / conflicted | `success` / `warning` / `error`                             |
| Machine, cache                                | `syntaxType`                                                |

| Model                                         | `text`, bold                                                |
| Sent `↑`                                      | `mdLink`                                                    |
| Received `↓`, speeds, done                    | `success`                                                   |
| Time to first token, money                    | `syntaxNumber`, then `warning` past $1 and `error` past $10 |
| Context                                       | `success`, `warning` past 70%, `error` past 90%             |
| Effort meter, the π                           | `thinkingMinimal` … `thinkingMax`, one per level            |
| Labels, units, separators                     | `dim`                                                       |
| Editor frame                                  | pi's effort border colour                                   |

Syntax tokens are borrowed on purpose: a theme spends its hues there, so they give the line variety that stays in the theme's family. The table lives in `src/render/paint.ts` as `ROLE_TOKENS`, and a test fails if any entry is ever a colour instead of a token.

## Settings

They live in the file every piece shares, `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-harness/settings.json`, under `look.`. The ones marked _project_ are also read from a trusted project.

| Key                 | Default                                                | Does                                                                                                                                                             |

### Segments

Any segment goes in any slot, in the order the slot lists them.

| Id             | Shows                                                                                                                              |

| `clock`        | The time                                                                                                                           |
| `model`        | `provider/model`, with the account in parentheses when one is in use                                                               |

| `request`      | This answer's tokens, with the cache                                                                                               |
| `costRate`     | This answer's cost per million tokens                                                                                              |
| `cost`         | The session's cost                                                                                                                 |

| `average`      | The session's average speeds, both ways                                                                                            |
| `statuses`     | What other packages report through `setStatus`, minus the ones placed on their own                                                 |
| `status:<key>` | One package's status, by the key it passes to `setStatus`                                                                          |

A `status:<key>` segment is how a package gets a place of its own. [`@adeildo/pi-ask-permission`](../ask-permission) reports its mode as `pi-ask-permission:mode`, and the mode says what happens to what you type, so by default it sits in the frame next to the model instead of in the footer with everything else. `@adeildo/pi-providers` still reports its account as `pi-providers:account`, but the `model` segment draws it in parentheses, so the statuses segment skips it.

## How it fits

When a line runs out of room, the least important pieces take their short form first (the folder becomes its last part, the model loses its provider, the effort meter loses its label), and then leave, one at a time. The two sides of a border compete for the same width, so an unimportant piece on the right leaves before an important one on the left. A line never goes empty: the last piece stays and is cut.

The frame is the editor pi already has. Typing, history, autocomplete and every app key stay pi's; the class only changes what the lines look like and shifts mouse clicks by the width of the frame. The spinner is pi's, embedded through pi's own hook, and the working line only speaks through `setWorkingMessage`.
